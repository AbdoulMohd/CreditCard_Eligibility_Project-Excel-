# Introduction
What factors play a role in credit card eligibility? Using a dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohit265/credit-card-eligibility-data-determining-factors), We will be taking a deep dive into the data using excel. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset of credit card eligibility, focusing on key determinants such as gender, income, account length, age, asset ownership, and more. 

## We will be using this data to answer the following questions:
1) Is there a significant difference in credit card eligibility between different genders?
2) How does income affect the likelihood of being eligible for a credit card?
3) What is the relationship between the length of an individual's account and their eligibility for a credit card?
4) What role does age play in determining an individual's eligibility for a credit card?

5) How does asset ownership, such as owning a car or property, influence credit card eligibility

# Data Cleaning 
[Before and After](/Dataset%20Img/)

### Steps to my data cleaning process are as follows:
* Gender Transformation: Changed 0 to Male and 1 to Female for readability.
* Binary Columns (Own Car, Own Property): Changed 0 to No and 1 to Yes for better clarity and consistency across all binary columns.
* Number of Children (Num_children): Grouped into categories: No Children, Few Children (1-2), Several Children (3-4), Many Children (5+).

   **Formula: =IF(I4=0, "No Children", IF(AND(I4>=1, I4<=2), "Few Children", IF(AND(I4>=3, I4<=4), "Several Children", "Many Children")))** 

* Account Length (Account_length): Grouped into categories: Short Term (â‰¤10), Medium Term (11-30), Long Term (31+).

  **Formula: =IF(L5<=10, "Short Term", IF(AND(L5>=11, L5<=30), "Medium Term", IF(L5>30, "Long Term", "N/A")))**
.
* Total Income (Total_income): Grouped into income levels: Low Income (<50,000), Medium Income (50,000-99,999), High Income (100,000-499,999), Very High Income (500,000+).

  **Formula: =IF(N4<50000, "Low Income", IF(N4<100000, "Medium Income", IF(N4<500000, "High Income", "Very High Income")))**

* Years Employed (Years_employed): Grouped into categories: Not Employed (0), New Employee (1-2), Mid-Level Employee (3-10), * Experienced Employee (11-20), Senior Employee (21+).

  **Formula: =IF(R2=0, "Not Employed", IF(R2<=2, "New Employee", IF(AND(R2>=3, R2<=10), "Mid-Level Employee", IF(AND(R2>=11, R2<=20), "Experienced Employee", "Senior Employee"))))**

* Age: Grouped into age categories: Young Adult (21-30), Adult (31-45), Middle-Aged (46-60), Senior (61-69).

  **Formula: =IF(P2<=30, "Young Adult", IF(P2<=45, "Adult", IF(P2<=60, "Middle-Aged", "Senior")))**

# Analysis
With the use of a pivot table and visualization tools, I will demonstrate relevant insights that answer the question at hand
1) ### Is there a significant difference in credit card eligibility between different genders?

   ![Male vs Female](https://github.com/AbdoulMohd/CreditCard_Eligibility_Project-Excel-/blob/main/%231%20Visualization/Eligibility%20By%20Gender.png?raw=true) ![](https://github.com/AbdoulMohd/CreditCard_Eligibility_Project-Excel-/blob/main/%231%20Visualization/Eligibility%20By%20Gender%20Visual.png?raw=true)
  
 The data above shows that there appears to be a slightly higher percentage of eligible individuals among Females (13.91%) compared to Males (12.84%). While there is a slight difference in credit card eligibility rates between genders, the difference is not substantial.

 Among individuals eligible for a credit card, 48% are male while 52% are female. This indicates a marginal but notable difference, suggesting that females have a higher likelihood of being eligible for a credit card compared to males.

2) ### How does income affect the likelihood of being eligible for a credit card?

![Eligibity By Income](https://github.com/AbdoulMohd/CreditCard_Eligibility_Project-Excel-/blob/main/%232%20Visualization/Eligibity%20By%20Income%20Visual.png?raw=true)  
![](https://github.com/AbdoulMohd/CreditCard_Eligibility_Project-Excel-/blob/main/%232%20Visualization/Eligibility%20By%20Income.png?raw=true) ![](https://github.com/AbdoulMohd/CreditCard_Eligibility_Project-Excel-/blob/main/%232%20Visualization/%25%20Eligibible.png?raw=true) 

Higher income levels generally correlate with a higher likelihood of being eligible for a credit card. The "Very High Income" group has the highest eligibility rate at 21.30%, indicating that income is a significant factor in credit card eligibility.
